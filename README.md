### what is the point?

- this package is a learning tool for me and hopefully others
- this package attempts to be a well documented and tested instance of a
  super basic client framework in nostr that can help others understand
  nostr quickly or get started sending messages in minutes.
- I use the basic client in a notebook to explore the idea having a sort
  of “sentinel” node that serves as a barebones client to rebroadcast
  user data across additional nostr relays. While this is a relatively
  simple concept I haven’t seen much discussion around the potential
  benefits and implications.

### why nbdev?

This library uses the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) framework to
aggregate some useful tools from
[python-nostr](https://github.com/jeffthibault/python-nostr) into a more
structured `client` class that could serve as the basis for other python
tools. `nbdev` is great because it allows for relatively easy
development of robust software with very readable and explanatory
documentation. It will almost certainly not be the most perfomant way to
implement much of what I am doing here, but I hope it can make the
[nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) protocol more
accessible to a wider audience.

## Install

> pip install is not yet implemented, but will be coming soon

``` sh
pip install nostrfastr
```

or alternatively, clone the github repositor [and refer to this
guide](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html) to get started
working in nbdev.

## How to use

``` python
from nostrfastr.client import Client
```

``` python
with Client(relay_urls=['wss://relay.damus.io']) as client:
    print('Are we connected?')
    print('\t', client.relay_manager.connection_statuses)
print('Are we connected?')
print('\t', client.relay_manager.connection_statuses)
```
