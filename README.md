rebroadcastr

### why does this exist?

- first and foremost this is a development project for me to get better
  at different components of software development. I hope this library
  can also be useful.
- In my experience using
  [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr), I have seen very
  inconsistent delivery of events to relays by different clients for all
  kinds (notes, recommended relays, metadata, contact lists). This
  library attempts to solve that by establishing a simple client that
  searches a set of relays for any user and rebroadcasts the event if it
  didn’t get published to a certain relay.

### is this good or bad for the nostr network

I am not sure how I feel about the concept of rebroadcasting. It is very
interesting that within the specification of the nostr protocol does not
make any rules about who can broadcast an event message. As long as the
message content has not been altered the message and the signature are
still valid no matter who is broadcasting it to what relay. Whether this
is good or bad is up for discussion, but it is the current reality that
this sort of usage is currently possible. A few interesting observations
that result from this simple fact. - broadcasting nodes can be used to
stabilize a user and his/her followers across relays consistently this
is desireable in at least two situations - clients used by the user are
not consistently reading and writing to all relays - user wants to
increase the relay overlap of his followed content even if a followed
contact is not broadcasting to many similar relays - user is creating
events from a device that has low-bandwidth and can only publish to a
smaller set of relays - (if/when pay per relay broadcast is implemented)
the user may want to publish right away to a small subset of relays and
broadcast to additional relays when demand is low - rebroadcasting could
have significant impacts on relay usage - because a rebroadcasting
client does not have to remain fast and snappy like a client with a user
interface it can broadcast more user data across more relays. Since
anyone can broadcast data from any public key to any relay this could
result in significantly more data duplication that harms less popular
nodes.
