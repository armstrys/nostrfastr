    "### What is this?\n",
    " - This package attempts to be a well documented and tested instance of a very basic client framework in nostr that can help others understand nostr quickly or get started sending messages in minutes.\n",
    " - Contained is a collection of tools built on top of this basic `Client` class showing some potential uses of nostr any how quickly we can build on it in python. \n",
    "     - A \"sentinel\" node that serves as a barebones client to rebroadcast user data across additional nostr relays. While this is a relatively simple concept I haven't seen much discussion around the potential benefits and implications.\n",
    "     - `notifyr` - a decorator that will alert on success or failure of any decorated function via nostr DM\n",
    "     - a vanity address generator decorated with the notifyr function so you can leave it running and get notified when it finishes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why nbdev?\n",
    "This library uses the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) framework to aggregate some useful tools from [python-nostr](https://github.com/jeffthibault/python-nostr) into a more structured `client` class that could serve as the basis for other python tools. `nbdev` is great because it allows for relatively easy development of code in-line with readable and explanatory documentation. This webpage is a rendering of the same notebooks that are exported to form the package code. If you clone the Github repository you can view and run the code you see in the documentation. It will almost certainly not be the most perfomant way to implement much of what I am doing here, but I hope it can make the [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) protocol more accessible to a wider audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known issues\n",
    " - `notifyr` - see the `notifyr` page for more detail on these issues\n",
    "     - `keyring` may need uninstalled dependencies on linux builds\n",
    "     - Current spec of nostr DMs is likely not adequate for secure usage of this module for sensitive data."
